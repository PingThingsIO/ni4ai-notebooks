Similar to the stream version, this is a monotonically increasing number but is only updated when the metadata changes. Annotations are well suited for user-defined metadata that may evolve over time.</dd>\n",

Luckily, the btrdb library comes with many convenience functions to help with converting between nanoseconds and other datetime formats.\n",
