    "In this tutorial we'll use the API to find data streams. The functionality is very similar to exploring data using the all streams table in the plotter. \n",

    "- A **point** is an individual measurement, consisting of a time stamp and a value.\n",
    "- A **stream** is a time series of points.\n",
    "- A **collection** is a grouping of streams -- for examples measurements streaming from a single sensor recording on multiple channels.\n",
